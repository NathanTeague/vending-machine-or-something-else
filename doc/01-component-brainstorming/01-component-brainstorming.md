# Portfolio Part 1: Component Brainstorming

- **Name**: Nathan Teague
- **Dot Number**: teague.108
- **Due Date**: 2/4 @ 11:59pm

## Assignment Overview

The overall goal of the portfolio project is to have you design and implement
your own OSU component. There are no limits to what you choose to design and
implement, but your component must fit within the constraints of our software
sequence discipline. In other words, the component must extend from Standard and
must include both a kernel and a secondary interface.

Because this is a daunting project, we will be providing you with a series of
activities to aid in your design decisions. For example, the point of this
assignment is to help you brainstorm a few possible components and get some
feedback. For each of these components, you will need to specify the high-level
design in terms of the software sequence discipline. In other words, you will
describe a component, select a few kernel methods for your component, and select
a few secondary methods to layer on top of your kernel methods.

You are not required to specify contracts at this time. However, you are welcome
to be as detailed as you'd like. More detail means you will be able to get more
detailed feedback, which may help you decide which component to ultimately
implement.

## Assignment Checklist

To be sure you have completed everything on this assignment, we have littered
this document with TODO comments. You can browse all of them in VSCode by
opening the TODOs window from the sidebar. The icon looks like a tree and will
likely have a large number next to it indicating the number of TODOS. You'll
chip away at that number over the course of the semester. However, if you'd
like to remove this number, you can disable it by removing the following
line from the `settings.json` file:

```json
"todo-tree.general.showActivityBarBadge": true,
```

Which is not to be confused with the following setting that adds the counts
to the tree diagram (you may remove this one as well):

```json
"todo-tree.tree.showCountsInTree": true,
```

## Assignment Learning Objectives

Without learning objectives, there really is no clear reason why a particular
assessment or activity exists. Therefore, to be completely transparent, here is
what we're hoping you will learn through this particular aspect of the portfolio
project. Specifically, students should be able to:

1. Integrate their areas of interest in their personal lives and/or careers with
   their knowledge of software design
2. Determine the achievablility of a software design given time constraints
3. Design high-level software components following the software sequence
   discipline

## Assignment Rubric: 10 Points

Again, to be completely transparent, most of the portfolio project, except the
final submission, is designed as a formative assessment. Formative assessments
are meant to provide ongoing feedback in the learning process. Therefore,
the rubric is designed to assess the learning objectives *directly* in a way
that is low stakesâ€”meaning you shouldn't have to worry about the grade. Just
do good work.

Below is further rationale/explanation for the rubric items above:

1. Each design must align with your personal values and long-term
   goals. Because the goal of this project is to help your build out a
   portfolio, you really ought to care about what you're designing. We'll give
   you a chance to share your personal values, interests, and long-term goals
   below.
2. Each design must be achievable over the course of a single
   semester. Don't be afraid to design something very small. There is no shame
   in keeping it simple.
3. Each design must fit within the software sequence discipline. In
   other words, your design should expect to inherit from Standard, and it
   should contain both kernel and secondary methods. Also, null and aliasing
   must be avoided, when possible. The methods themselves must also be in
   justifiable locations, such as kernel or secondary.

  I'm Nathan and one of the things I'm interested in is rock climbing. I have the
right build for it, skinny and tall, so I'm not half bad. Another one of my 
interests is definitely coding, even though I can't really say I've done it 
recreationally. I love watching videos about game dev though. I'm a Data 
Analytics major, and I love the CSE side WAY more than the STATS side, at least 
right now. I love watching videos about game dev though. Besides that, I enjoy 
listening to music, hanging out with friends, working out, reading, writing. 
 
  As far as career goals go, I'm looking to build my resume with experiences and
hopefully land a well paying job, ideally remote in some capacity, to support
a family!

## Assignment

As previously stated, you are tasked with brainstorming 3 possible components.
To aid you in this process, we have provided [some example components][example-components]
that may help you in your brainstorming. All of these components were made at
some point by one of your peers, so you should feel confident that you can
accomplish any of them.

There is no requirement that you use any of the components listed above.
If you want to model something else, go for it! Very common early object
projects usually attempt to model real-world systems like banks, cars,
etc. Make of this whatever seems interesting to you, and keep in mind that
you're just brainstorming right now. You do not have to commit to anything.

### Example Component

To help you brainstorm a few components, we've provided an example below of a
component you already know well: NaturalNumber. We highly recommend that you
mirror the formatting as close as possible in your designs. By following this
format, we can be more confident that your designs will be possible.

- Example Component: `NaturalNumber`
  - **Description**:
    - The purpose of this component is to model a non-negative
      integer. Our intent with this design was to keep a simple kernel that
      provides the minimum functionality needed to represent a natural number.
      Then, we provide more complex mathematical operations in the secondary
      interface.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - `void multiplyBy10(int k)`: multiplies `this` by 10 and adds `k`
    - `int divideBy10()`: divides `this` by 10 and reports the remainder
    - `boolean isZero()`: reports whether `this` is zero
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - `void add(NaturalNumber n)`: adds `n` to `this`
    - `void subtract(NaturalNumber n)`: subtracts `n` from `this`
    - `void multiply(NaturalNumber n)`: multiplies `this` by `n`
    - `NaturalNumber divide(NaturalNumber n)`: divides `this` by `n`, returning
      the remainder
    - ...
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes, basically all OSU components have to be mutable as long as they
        inherit from Standard. `clear`, `newInstance`, and `transferFrom` all
        mutate `this`.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - No. All methods work with integers or other NaturalNumbers.
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - Yes. NaturalNumber is base 10, and we track that in a constant called
          `RADIX`.
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes. The kernel methods `multiplyBy10` and `divideBy10` can be used to
        manipulate our natural number as needed. For example, to implement
        `increment`, we can trim the last digit off with `divideBy10`, add 1 to
        it, verify that the digit hasn't overflown, and multiply the digit back.
        If the digit overflows, we reset it to zero and recursively call
        `increment`.

Keep in mind that the general idea when putting together these layered designs
is to put the minimal implementation in the kernel. In this case, the kernel is
only responsible for manipulating a digit at a time in the number. The secondary
methods use these manipulations to perform more complex operations like
adding two numbers together.

Also, keep in mind that we don't know the underlying implementation. It would be
completely reasonable to create a `NaturalNumber1L` class which layers the
kernel on top of the existing `BigInteger` class in Java. It would also be
reasonable to implement `NaturalNumber2` on top of `String` as seen in
Project 2. Do not worry about your implementations at this time.

On top of everything above, there is no expectation that you have a perfect
design. Part of the goal of this project is to have you actually use your
component once it's implemented to do something interesting. At which point, you
will likely refine your design to make your implementation easier to use.

### Component Designs

> Please use this section to share your designs.

- Component Design #1: Vending Machine
  - **Description**:
    - I got the idea for this component from our most recent assignments/project
    related to hashing. It's a pretty simple idea, but it basically would be a 
    sequence of sequences of queues, or maybe some other component at the bottom. 
    I know you said not to worry about implementation yet but that's how I 
    got the idea. You would be able to buy something from the "vending machine"
    by inputting the coordinate of the item you want, such as "A1", to get the
    corresponding column sequence and row sequence and then take a drink off the 
    queue. I'm still uncertain of how I'd do it, but I want to add some sort of 
    price/money system to this as well. So maybe it's a map at the bottom, not a
    queue. Again, I don't know how I'd do this, but I'm going to act under the 
    assumption that this is a part of the component.
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - T buy(?): Either buy by inputting the name of the item or by typing in 
    the coordinates. Also may need some way to insert money. Removes and returns 
    the selected item from the vending machine
    - int size(): returns the amount of items in the vending machine
    - void addStock(?): Add an item to the vending machine by either inputting 
    a coordinate to add to or an item to add.
    - int price(?): returns the price of an item
    - int balance(): returns available balance of money
    - void setBalance(int): sets balance to given number
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - void restock(): Fill every spot full of its item (again, since I want a 
    max size for each spot, queue may not be the move, maybe array?)
    - int totalValue(): returns the cost of every item in the vending machine
    put together
    - ? changeStock(?, ?): Takes out a queue or whatever of items and replaces it
    with a different queue of items, returning the taken out stock
    - ? buyAll(?): If have enough balance, take out the entirety of a queue, subtract
    the cost from balance, and return the queue.
    - T buyAny(): Buys a random item that you can afford.
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes. This components purpose would be to insert and take out items from 
      the vending machine
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - I'm not sure. It's definitely possible, and I think it will if I implement
      the money system. I don't know for sure though
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - I don't know. I don't know the size of the vending machine in any direction,
      I could either let the client decide the size of the vending machine, or I could
      set it. 
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes, I believe so. For example, restock would be implementing by using 
      kernel addStock to every queue until they are all "full" (whatever that means)
      totalValue() would use price() on every item, changeStock would have to use
      buy and addStock while preserving the balance of money, buyAll and buyAny 
      would also use buy 

- Component Design #2: Route Tracker
  - **Description**:
    - This comes from my rock climbing interest. This component would essentially
    act as a journal, logging every rock climbing "route" completed. The route 
    would have a difficulty assigned to it, as well as maybe other values, such 
    as fun value, length, time took to complete etc. It would also have a 
    comments section where you could add things you wanted to say about the route. 
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - addRoute(route): enter a full route, perhaps represented as a sequence or 
    queue or map, that has every detail necessary about the route
    - route clearRoute(route): removes and returns specified route
    - int numOfRoutes(): gives numOfRoutes in route tracker
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - int difficulty(route): Gives the number rating inputted for difficulty
    of specified route
    - String comments(route): Gives the comment inputted for specified route
    - int attemptsTaken(route): Gives the amount of attempts it took to complete
    the route.
    - int enjoyment(route): Gives the number rating for enjoyment of route
    - route mostDifficult(): Returns the highest rated difficulty, or if tied,
    a random of the highest
    - route mostFun(): Returns the highest rated enjoyment, or if tied,
    a random of the highest
    - route mostAttempts(): Returns the highest attempted route, or if tied,
    a random of the highest
    - ? listOfRoutes(?, ?): Returns a list of the routes with specified parameter, 
    such as difficulty rating, attempts, or enjoyment
    - void editRoute(route, ?, ?): edits specified parameter of specified route and 
    updates it
    - route viewRoute(route): Returns details of requested route
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes. You could add, remove, or edit the routes stored
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - Maybe. It depends on how I implement the route storing
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - I don't think so? I'm unsure but I do not believe so
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes. For example, all of the secondary methods returning details about a 
      route would do so by removing the specified route and examining it. The
      most methods would iterate through all the routes to find the required one,
      and the editRoute would remove a route and add the same route with the 
      changes.

- Component Design #3: Music Playlist
  - **Description**:
    - Idea comes from list of ideas and my interest in listening to music. Would
    act as a music playlist that you could add or remove songs from, and you would
    have a way to play certain songs or reorder them
  - **Kernel Methods**:
    - void add(int, song): Adds specified song to specified location in playlist
    - song remove(int): Removes song at specified int
    - int size(): returns size of playlist
  - **Secondary Methods**:
    - void shuffle(): Shuffles the order of songs in the playlist
    - void move(int, int): Moves song at one location to the other
    - void merge(playlist): Adds playlist to end of other playlist
    - void reverse(): reverses order of playlist
  - **Additional Considerations** (*note*: "I don't know" is an acceptable
    answer for each of the following questions):
    - Would this component be mutable? Answer and explain:
      - Yes. I would change this component with the methods.
    - Would this component rely on any internal classes (e.g., `Map.Pair`)?
      Answer and explain:
      - No. It shouldn't because it doesn't have a lot of moving parts
    - Would this component need any enums or constants (e.g.,
      `Program.Instruction`)? Answer and explain:
      - No it shouldn't unless the playlist has a max size
    - Can you implement your secondary methods using your kernel methods?
      Answer, explain, and give at least one example:
      - Yes. Shuffle would have to remove and add songs in a certain way. move would
      also use add and remove. Merge would use add. reverse would use add and remove

## Post-Assignment

The following sections detail everything that you should do once you've
completed the assignment.

### Changelog

At the end of every assignment, you should update the
[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) file found in the root of the project folder.
Since this is likely the first time you've done this, we would recommend
browsing the existing file. It includes all of the changes made to the portfolio
project template. When you're ready, you should delete this file and start your
own. Here's what I would expect to see at the minimum:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/) of
the following form: YYYY.0M.0D.

## 2025.02.03

### Added

- Designed a vending machine component
- Designed a Route Tracker component
- Designed a Music Playlist component
```

Here `YYYY.MM.DD` would be the date of your submission, such as 2024.04.21.

You may notice that things are nicely linked in the root CHANGELOG. If you'd
like to accomplish that, you will need to make GitHub releases after each pull
request merge (or at least tag your commits). This is not required.

In the future, the CHANGELOG will be used to document changes in your
designs, so we can gauge your progress. Please keep it updated at each stage
of development.

### Submission

If you have completed the assignment using this template, we recommend that
you convert it to a PDF before submission. If you're not sure how, check out
this [Markdown to PDF guide][markdown-to-pdf-guide]. However, PDFs should be
created for you automatically every time you save, so just double check that
all your work is there before submitting. For future assignments, you will
just be submitting a link to a pull request. This will be the only time
you have to submit any PDFs.

### Peer Review

Following the completion of this assignment, you will be assigned three
students' component brainstorming assignments for review. Your job during the
peer review process is to help your peers flesh out their designs. Specifically,
you should be helping them determine which of their designs would be most
practical to complete this semester. When reviewing your peers' assignments,
please treat them with respect. Note also that we can see your comments, which
could help your case if you're looking to become a grader. Ultimately, we
recommend using the following feedback rubric to ensure that your feedback is
both helpful and respectful (you may want to render the markdown as HTML or a
PDF to read this rubric as a table).
